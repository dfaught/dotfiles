My important dot flies...

Many (most) of the configurations in these dot files have been discovered through the openness and generosity of others.
The road to this configuration which works really well for me would have been much longer and significantly more bump
without their kindmess. Where possible I have left their names in the files and will eventually find a way to fork or
link back to their originals so they receive proper credit.
