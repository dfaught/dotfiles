# dotfiles
These are my dotfiles.  There are many like them but these are mine.

Of course there are many like them because I've compiled a lot of my settings from a wide variety of sources, especially within .vim.  There are far to many people to credit but if you spend the time to think who has influenced the way you use Vim I've probably acquired a great deal from them.
